A secure, client-side web application to beautifully render your exported WhatsApp chat history. Transform your `.txt` or `.zip` chat exports into a clean, familiar, and browsable interface‚Äîright in your browser.

**Your data remains yours. No uploads, no cloud, just your chats, for your eyes only.**

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Familiar Interface**: Renders your chat log in a classic, easy-to-read messenger-style UI.
-   **Complete Media Support**: Works with both standard `.txt` exports and `.zip` archives. View images, watch videos, listen to audio notes, and see stickers directly in the chat.
-   üîí **100% Private & Secure**: All parsing and rendering happens locally in your web browser. Your chats and media files are **never** uploaded to a server, ensuring absolute privacy.
-   **User Filtering**: In group chats, easily filter the conversation to show or hide messages from specific participants.
-   **Simple to Use**: Just drag and drop your exported WhatsApp file to get started instantly.
-   **Modern & Fast**: Built with React and Vite for a smooth, responsive, and modern user experience.

## üöÄ How It Works

1.  **Export Your Chat**: Open WhatsApp on your phone, go to the desired chat, and use the "Export Chat" option. For the best experience, choose **"Include Media"** to generate a `.zip` file.
2.  **Open the Viewer**: Navigate to the WhatsApp Chat Viewer application in your web browser.
3.  **Drag & Drop**: Drag the exported `.zip` or `.txt` file onto the upload area.
4.  **View Your Chat**: The application will instantly process the file and display your entire chat history in a clean, interactive format.

## üîí Your Privacy is Paramount

We believe your conversations are private. This application was architected with a "privacy-first" approach. The magic happens entirely on your machine using JavaScript in your browser.

-   **No Server Communication**: The app does not send your data over the internet.
-   **No Data Storage**: Your chats are not stored or cached by us. Once you close the browser tab, the data is gone until you load the file again.
-   **Client-Side Logic**: The powerful `ChatParser` and `JSZip` libraries work locally to read and display your content securely.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

-   **Frontend**: React.js
-   **Build Tool**: Vite
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first styling approach.
-   **File Processing**: [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) for handling `.zip` archives.
